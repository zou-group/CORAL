## CORAL: Comprehensive spatial Omics Registration and Analysis for Learning spatial features

CORAL is a probabilistic, graph-based method designed to integrate diverse spatial omics datasets. 
Taking multimodality molecular profiles of unmatched spatial resolution and detected features, CORAL generates single-cell embedding with information from both data modalities, 
deconvolves the lower-resolution modality to infer its profile in individual cells, and predicts interactions between neighboring cells.
